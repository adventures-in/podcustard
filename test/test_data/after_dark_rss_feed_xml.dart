    <description>Serial investigative journalism from APM Reports, with host Madeleine Baran and a team of reporters. In Season 1, we looked at the abduction of Jacob Wetterling in rural Minnesota and the accountability of sheriffs in solving crime. In Season 2, we examined the case of Curtis Flowers, who has been tried six times for the same crime. He's won appeal after appeal, but every time, prosecutor Doug Evans just tries the case again.</description>

        <![CDATA[On Friday, June 21, after months of deliberation, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its opinion in the Curtis Flowers case. In a 7-2 ruling, the justices threw out the conviction from his sixth trial, in 2010. The decision of what happens next -- whether to release Flowers or begin a seventh trial -- now lies with the same prosecutor who's pursued him from the beginning: Doug Evans.   <a href="https://support.americanpublicmedia.org/ITD_PodcastFeed">Support investigative journalism with a donation to In the Dark</a>.]]>

      <title>S2 E1: July 16, 1996</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On the morning of July 16, 1996, someone walked into a furniture store in downtown Winona, Mississippi, and murdered four employees. Each was shot in the head. It was perhaps the most shocking crime the small town had ever seen. Investigators charged a man named Curtis Flowers with the murders. What followed was a two-decade legal odyssey in which Flowers was tried six times for the same crime. He remains on death row, though some people believe he's innocent. For the second season of In the Dark, we spent a year digging into the Flowers case. We found a town divided by race and a murder conviction supported by questionable evidence. And it all began that summer morning in 1996 with a horrifying crime scene that left investigators puzzled.   <a href="https://support.americanpublicmedia.org/ITD_PodcastFeed">Support investigative journalism with a donation to In the Dark</a>.]]>

      <title>S1 E8: What's Going on Down There?</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In November 2012, a police officer named Tom Decker was shot and killed in Cold Spring, Minn., after getting out of his car to check on a man who lived above a bar. The man was quickly arrested and held in the Stearns County jail. He was interrogated but then released without charges. The state crime bureau later ruled him out as a suspect. Investigators turned their focus to another man, Eric Thomes, who hanged himself before he could be charged with the crime. Nearly four years after the murder, Sheriff John Sanner has refused to close the case "because we're still hopeful that new information will come in," he said.   <a href="https://support.americanpublicmedia.org/ITD_PodcastFeed">Support investigative journalism with a donation to In the Dark</a>.]]>

      <title>S1 E5: Person of Interest</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Dan Rassier now wishes he'd insisted that police search his family's St. Joseph farm top to bottom the night Jacob Wetterling was abducted. That way, they would have known there was nothing to find. And it would have been harder for them to come back 21 years later to search with backhoes and declare him a "person of interest" in the case.   <a href="https://support.americanpublicmedia.org/ITD_PodcastFeed">Support investigative journalism with a donation to In the Dark</a>.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[The closest you can get to a conversation with Jacob Wetterling about his abduction is to talk to Jared Scheierl. Scheierl was walking home from an ice skating rink in Cold Spring in January 1989 when a man who turned out to be Danny Heinrich forced him into a car, assaulted him, and let him go, uttering some chilling parting words: "If they come close to finding out who I am, I'll find you and kill you." That was nine months before Jacob's abduction.   <a href="https://support.americanpublicmedia.org/ITD_PodcastFeed">Support investigative journalism with a donation to In the Dark</a>.]]>
